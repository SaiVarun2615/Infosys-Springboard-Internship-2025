## 🔹 Introduction Session

Today was the first meeting of the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship.  
Our mentor introduced himself and explained how the internship will work — mainly practical, collaborative sessions instead of traditional classes.

Each intern gave a short introduction.  
Here is mine:

**I’m Bata Sai Varun from Hyderabad, currently pursuing B.Tech CSE at KMIT.  
I’m interested in AI, automation, and software development and joined this internship to gain real project experience with NLP and ML.**

# 📌 **Prerequisites for the Project (As Explained by Mentor)**

Our mentor clearly mentioned the essential skills required to work on any AI/ML project — especially this one.

### ✔ 1. Strong Python Programming
- Writing clean, modular code  
- Understanding loops, functions, OOP  
- Handling files, modules, JSON, CSV, etc.

### ✔ 2. ML Libraries (Must Know)
Basic ML + Python libraries:
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Pandas** – data handling & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib** – visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn** – basic ML models  
- **PyTorch** – for deep learning models

### ✔ 3. Mathematical Foundations
A person should have good knowledge of:
- **Linear Algebra**  
- **Probability & Statistics**  
- **Differentiation / Gradients**  
These are used in ML/DL operations.

### ✔ 4. Data Handling Skills
Understanding how to work with various data types:
- CSV data  
- Images  
- Audio  
- Video  
- Text  
And also how to perform:
- **Preprocessing**  
- **Cleaning**  
- **Standardization / Normalization**

The mentor emphasized that ML/DL = 80% data work and 20% modeling.

# 📚 **What I Learned Today**
- The internship will be practical and discussion-based.
- Real ML/NLP projects need strong basics.
- The project will involve research paper reading → text processing → summarization.
- We will identify our knowledge gaps in the next few sessions.

# 🎯 **My Action Plan**
To prepare for upcoming sessions, I will:
1. Revise Python fundamentals  
2. Practice NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn  
3. Study basic linear algebra & statistics  
4. Learn text preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords, stemming, TF-IDF, embeddings)

# 🚀 **Conclusion**
Day 1 was an orientation session focused on expectations and prerequisites.  
I’m excited to work under the guidance of our mentor and learn real-world NLP techniques.

More updates coming soon!
