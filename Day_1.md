## 🔹 Introduction Session
The internship began with a discussion-based orientation. Our mentor explained the overall flow of the program — focused more on practical learning, collaboration, and understanding real-world AI concepts rather than classroom-style teaching.

All interns introduced themselves.  
**My Introduction:**  
I am **Bata Sai Varun** from **Hyderabad**, currently pursuing **B.Tech CSE at KMIT**. I’m interested in **AI, automation, and practical ML/NLP projects**, and I joined this internship to gain real hands-on experience.

### **2. Necessary ML Libraries**
- **NumPy** — numerical operations  
- **Pandas** — data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** — visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** — basic ML  
- **PyTorch** — deep learning  

### **3. Mathematical Foundations**
Needed for any ML/DL project:
- Linear algebra  
- Probability  
- Statistics  
- Differentiation / gradients  

### **4. Data Handling**
Ability to work with:
- CSV  
- Images  
- Audio  
- Video
